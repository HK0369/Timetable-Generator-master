🚀 Project Title & Tagline
-------------------------

### Timetable Generator
**Tagline:** "Effortlessly create timetables for your institution with our intuitive web application"

📖 Description
-------------

The Timetable Generator is a static website that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface for generating timetables. This project is designed to facilitate the creation of timetables for educational institutions, making it easier for administrators to manage schedules and resources. With a simple and intuitive interface, users can input data and generate a timetable that meets their specific needs.

✨ Features
------------

1. **User-friendly interface**: The website features a clean and intuitive design, making it easy for users to input data and generate a timetable.
2. **Data input**: Users can input data such as courses, instructors, rooms, and students, allowing for customized timetable creation.
3. **Timetable generation**: The website uses algorithms to generate a timetable based on the input data, taking into account course schedules, instructor availability, and room capacities.
4. **Customization options**: Users can adjust settings such as the duration of each course, the number of rooms available, and the instructor-to-student ratio.
5. **Real-time updates**: The website updates the timetable in real-time, allowing users to see changes as they are made.
6. **Export options**: Users can export the generated timetable to a CSV file or print it directly from the website.
7. **Error handling**: The website includes error handling mechanisms to ensure that invalid input data does not cause errors or crashes.
8. **Responsive design**: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it looks and functions well on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
9. **Accessibility features**: The website includes features such as font size adjustment, high contrast mode, and screen reader compatibility to ensure accessibility for all users.
10. **Analytics**: The website includes analytics features to track user behavior, providing insights on how users interact with the website and identify areas for improvement.
11. The timetabling problems are essentially the problems that deal with effective distribution of resources. 
12. During the timetabling process many constraints have to be considered. Resources are usually limited and no two tasks should occupy one particular resource at the same time. For most of the timetabling problems it has been shown that they are NP-hard, and that they can not be solved in polynomial time using a deterministic algorithm. Hence, genetic algorithms could provide us with a feasible solution in a reasonable time.
13. Our project is titled “TIME TABLE GENERATOR FOR COLLEGE”. The "Timetable Generator" simplifies scheduling with these key features:
14. Automated Timetable Generation: It automates timetable creation based on teacher availability, classroom capacity, and course requirements.
15. Customizable Templates: Administrators can create templates for various schedules, making it adaptable to different academic or organizational structures.
16. Conflict Resolution: The system identifies and resolves scheduling conflicts, ensuring optimal resource allocation.
17. Integration: Seamless integration with existing systems ensures smooth data exchange.
18. Methods Used: It leverages MVC Architecture, and robust database management,Genetic Algorithm.
